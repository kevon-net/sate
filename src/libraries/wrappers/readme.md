# Wrappers Folder

In a project, a custom wrapper around a third-party library refers to an abstraction layer that you create to encapsulate the third-party library's functionality. This wrapper serves as a middleman between your application and the library, providing several benefits such as:

1. **Encapsulation**: It hides the direct usage of the third-party library within your project, offering a more tailored interface that better fits your application's needs.

2. **Decoupling**: By wrapping the third-party library, your code doesn't directly depend on it. If the library needs to be replaced in the future, you only need to modify the wrapper instead of refactoring the entire codebase.

3. **Custom Logic**: You can add your own logic or error handling around the library's methods or functions, which might not be possible with direct library usage.

4. **Consistency**: Wrappers allow you to standardize how your team interacts with the third-party library, enforcing consistent patterns or behavior.
