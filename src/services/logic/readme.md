# Logic Folder

Business logic refers to the core functionality that defines how specific business processes, rules, and workflows are handled within a project. It involves the decision-making and processing that align with the objectives, needs, and constraints of the business or application domain. In simple terms, it's the set of rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and modified, and how users can interact with the system.

## Characteristics of Business Logic

1. **Domain-Specific**: Business logic is unique to the application or business. For example, an online shopping store would have rules for inventory management, checkout processes, and order handling.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is usually separated from other types of code like user interface logic (UI/UX) and data access logic (communication with databases) to keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and scalable.

3. **Validation and Calculations**: It includes validations (e.g., ensuring a user's order doesn't exceed stock) and calculations (e.g., tax calculations, discounts, and shipping costs).

4. **Decision-Making**: Business logic dictates what happens under certain conditions, such as deciding if a user can access certain features based on their account type or performing an action if an order is above a certain amount.

## Example in a Project

For a **fashion shopping store**:

- **Adding to Cart**: Business logic would ensure items are available in stock before adding them to the cart.
- **Order Processing**: When the user checks out, the logic would check payment validity, apply any discount codes, update stock, and send confirmation emails.

In your projects, especially the CMS or online store, business logic could govern actions like user role management, content approvals, or how inventory gets updated in real-time.
